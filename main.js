document.getElementById("p").innerHTML="The series is set in the fictional Kingdom of Dholakpur, somewhere in rural India. The series revolves around Bheem, sometimes referred to as Chhota Bheem (little Bheem) due to his young age, a boy who is strong and intelligent. Bheem's rival is Kalia, who is envious of Bheem's popularity. Kalia, along with his sidekicks, twin brothers Dholu and Bholu, always plot to embarrass and defeat Bheem, but never succeed.Most of the initial stories revolved around Bheem and his friends Chutki, Raju and Jaggu's rivalry with Kalia and his friends Dholu and bholu. However, as the series has progressed, this topic has been adopted as the subject less often, although Kalia is still sometimes eager to prove himself superior to Bheem, he was become a better friend of Bheem. A large number of episodes along with all the films also focus on Bheem and his team solving various problems affecting the village, unravelling mysteries, fighting evils that seek to harm Dholakpur or its inhabitants, and on their antics which often get them into trouble.During Bheem's early days, the broadcaster Pogo had stressed that storyline be kept simple and mysteries and complex plot avoided at all cost, as the viewers were too young to understand, but nowadays there is no such restriction. The timeline and Dholakpur too have been allowed to become fluid and stretchable and this has caused the characters to become more person-like and less childish. Supernatural events have often been used in episodes, like Dholakpur being attacked by the demon Zimbara, the evil witch, or Botakhpur. Bheem and his team participating in various competitions in Dholakpur or in adjoining kingdoms is also a common theme, as is the celebration of Indian festivities.Indian animated series Chhota Bheem recently made headlines after the hashtag #JusticeForChutki became a Twitter trend. The viewers of the kids’ show were upset after news emerged of Chhota Bheem marrying Rajkumari Indumati, and leaving his best friend Chutki who did so much for him.However, the makers of the kids’ show denied the rumours of Chhota Bheem marrying princess Indumati. Releasing a statement on Facebook, they wrote, “We would like everyone to know that all the characters in the show including Chhota Bheem, Chutki and Indumati are all still kids. The viral news stating the characters got married is false and we request everyone to refrain from commenting on it.”On behalf of Green Gold Animation, the makers of Chhota Bheem, we would like to thank all our fans and supporters who have shown lots of love to their favorite characters in Chhota Bheem.Chhota Bheem is indeed famous. In India, unless you're living under a rock, you would know him. It is hard to not come across this dhoti-clad guy on school bags, bottles, tshirts, television ads, or among the other simple obsessions of kids. According to a report, in 2011 and 2012 Chhota Bheem beat Doraemon for being the most popular kids show in India. It was created in 2008, airs on Pogo and its target audience is mostly three-to-ten.For a long time, there was(is) a monopoly of foreign cartoons on Indian TV, be it American or Japanese. Original content was getting produced, but it never had any significant support. The start of Indian content was by delving into mythological stories. Mythology held an inherent appeal, obviously, but soon it became stale. The same template of mythological heroes was getting repeated, with tons of Krishna, Ganesh, Hanuman even Ghatotkacha being produced for children. Krishna alone had three to four independent series on him. There was nothing original in them, neither were they any successful in getting any significant fanbase or any merchandizing effort.At first, Chhota Bheem was a gamble. Animations are expensive to make. And unless you have the Disney-like revenues from toys and stuff, they hard to run. It was more profitable to simply dub foreign shows than to create new. Or rely on the tried-and-tested mythological stuff.Chhota Bheem offered something new from the stale templates. The character, though inspired from Mahabharata's Bheem, soon came to have little semblance with him. The series did not have much mythological linkings. Hence, they were free to explore a lot of themes that were previously not accessible. They were able to feature Roman Gladiators, Genghiz Khan, Indonesian mythological demons, Japanese Shinobis, Shaolin monks, Persian carpet magicians, Arabian Nights, with complete freedom.Chhota Bheem offered something new from the stale templates.

Moreover, their reasons for liking something may be not be the same as grown ups. Also, I'm not going home for a lot of time hence I can't interview the neighbouring kids. So, it is going to be hard to pinpoint the reasons why kids love Chhota Bheem (or Doraemon, for instance). I'll try to guess though.Chhota Bheem combines the traditional Indian storytelling setting - the once-upon-a-time style, kings, magic, demons - with the modern cool stuff - kung fu, zombies, aliens, time-machines, ninjas, etc. There is a great amount of fantasical stuff - be it evil serpents, cute yeti babies, benevolent dragons, various kinds of demons and wizards, etc. And who doesn't love fantasy?Chhota Bheem does an outstanding job of depicting cultures. I watched an episode about Kathmandu and loved the documentary-ish description of the food, architecture and life in Nepal. There have been many episodes about East Asian Culture, be it Japanese Ninjas or Chinese monks or Indonesian mythology. Did I mention the target audience of this show is 3 to 10?";

document.getElementById("p").innerHTML="Inspired by the real-life story of a kid, Shinnosuke Nohara, Shinchan is the most beloved cartoon series. Shinnosuke Nohara, a chilled kid and always up to some mischief sort of child, died in a car accident. Like the other days, one day, the Nohara Family went to the supermarket for the usual groceries purchasing, and suddenly Shinnosuke noticed his little sister, Himawari, crossing the trail all by herself, without any assistance.Shinnosuke ran to rescue her but unfortunately faced an accident with a car. Both Shinnosuke and Himawari died a fateful death, a death unexpected, and unprecedented. After this occurrence, Misae, the mother of Shinnosuke and Himawari, slipped into the swamps of despair and depression.Misae started carving her kids on a scrapbook, the joyful moments that they enjoyed together, the playfulness of Shinnosuke, and the fights of both. She used to visualize how her son and her daughter would have been if they were alive. Misae’s scrapbook inspired Yoshita Usui, the illustrator of the cartoon series Shin-chan. He decided to create an anime by the title “Crayon Shinchan” Yes, all those comic moves of Shinchan and his outlandish replies to various people is the creation of her mother. Of course, with a pinch of ingenuity and creativeness of the illustrator.Crayon Shinchan made its first appearance in 1990 through a Japanese weekly magazine called ‘Weekly Manga action’ published by Futabasha. More than 275 million copies of the manga have been sold worldwide in the last 20 years. The series was first aired on TV Asahi in 1992. Until today, the series has been dubbed in 30 dialects and is televised in 45 countries.Kids run, jump and race around the house when it is 5 pm, which means time for “Shinchan.” This cartoon has succeeded to influence not just little kids but adults as well and to our amazement, the old aged too. The episodes are gaining a global fame for just a bunch of lame jokes and a terrifically humored story plot. Black comedy and slap sticks make the cartoon series “a wanted dose” broadcasted around the globe. Toy firms made fair bucks selling Shinchan toys and cups, and even the fashion brand themed their casual attires displaying “the great Shinchan prints.” The series is the highest gross animated franchise, with sales of over a 100 million copies!It was a relaxing evening when I flipped the television channels to get going with some music, I encountered “Shinchan” among the flips and thought it was my subconscious “what a humorous characterization, the maker has built.” I thought. Creating a character like him is a sheer excellence of creativity. I spurred to reach my phone to search brains behind the television cartoon series “Shinchan, ” and a saying came to stand true “The funniest visions may behold the deepest sufferings.” My heart fastened, and face frowned to read the story behind the world famous television cartoon series “Shinchan.”Shinchan is inspired by the real life kid “Shinnosuke Nohara” who faced death in a car accident. His mother “Misae” went in misery and gloom after the son’s death, Misae started sketching Shinchan in his remembrance. She described him frequently, his fun days and all her flash of memory were creatively portrayed in the bundles of sketches she drew. Later, a cartoonist Yoshita Usai gazed at those beautiful drawings and offered to develop these memories into a Japanese magazine daily, which then gained immense ratings and popularity. Shinchan was translated into diverse language and started selling worldwide. The crayons of her mother embraced the emergence of the cartoon series “Crayon Shinchan.”It is also the fact that, the cartoon series would never air the last episode of the series that would move with the original story where he dies saving his younger sister from a car accident on the town’s road. Well, the internet is a hub of opinions, lies, and reality. Perhaps, Shinchan fans also excelled in their research skills, claiming that; The author and creator of the cartoon series “Yoshito Usui worked at a shop in his early days, called “Darakuya store.”The store owner was Shinnosuke Nikaido. In 1987, Shinnosuke Nikaido started his manga cartoon series career by creating a series called “Darakuya Store Monogatari” these series beheld the life experiences of an author “Shinnosuke Nikaido.” The series was later published in the magazine Weekly Manga Action. “Shinnosuke Nohara” was one of its characters in his series which grabbed Yoshita Usai who transformed it successfully into the show we know today.In a world full of problems, Shinchan seems like a character high on life.

document.getElementById("p").innerHTML="Oggy and the Cockroaches (French: Oggy et les Cafards) is a French comedy-adventure animated television series produced by Gaumont Multimedia (first two seasons) and Xilam Animation (third season onwards), and created by Jean-Yves Raimbaud, co-creator of Space Goofs, who died during production of Oggy's first season. It loosely resembles the American animated franchise Tom and Jerry by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The show employs silent comedy: characters either do not speak or use unintelligible vocalizations and gestures. The show premiered in September 1998 on France 3, and later expanded internationally.In September 2020, a reboot series was announced, entitled Oggy and the Cockroaches: Next Generation, in which Oggy takes care of Piya, a seven-year-old female elephant from India.[4][5] It was released worldwide in Netflix on July 28, 2022, with 13 episodes compiling 6 segments. Although it differs noticeably from the original in terms of its visuals and tone, Gulli labels it as Oggy's eighth season.Oggy, an anthropomorphic cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating but is continually pestered by three roaches: Joey, Marky and Dee Dee. The cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. In many situations, Oggy is also helped by Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the cockroaches. Bob, a short-tempered bulldog, also appears in the show and is Oggy's neighbor.Oggy, an anthropomorphic cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating but is continually pestered by three roaches: Joey, Marky and Dee Dee.

In many situations, Oggy is also helped by Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the cockroaches. Bob, a short-tempered bulldog, also appears in the show and is Oggy's neighbor.Oggy's defining trait is arguably his laziness, enjoying watching television, eating and on a couple of instances, listening to music. As usual, Oggy always chasing the cockroaches around the house when everytime they keep getting on his nerves. According to online descriptions, he is fond of the ideal home, game shows, listening to polka records, and eating chips in the bath. In addition, he is mentioned to fantasize about attaining a self-cleaning oven or a 12 gear vacuum on The Wheel of Fortune. He also displays a love for gardening and board games.Despite his lazy nature, Oggy is a diplomatic and easy-natured cat. He often displays kindness toward animals and often takes care of them. Indeed, he could not bring himself to kill an octopus in one episode. In spite of appearing to have a calm demeanor, Oggy will retaliate without hesitation when provoked (predominantly by the Cockroaches). In some episodes, while attempting to hit the Cockroaches with his swatter, Oggy hits lots of food with his swatter. Thus, Oggy can also make a mess and waste lots of food. Oggy is a great cook/baker as he makes tasty and delicious food in some episodes (good examples of this can be a cake and a chicken). He is often seen taking food out of his red oven (located in the dining room/kitchen) with the help of gloves.In several episodes, Oggy has been shown to have five main phobias: hydrophobia (fear of water), musophobia (fear of rats/mice), trypanophobia (fear of needles), acrophobia (fear of heights), and aviophobia/aerophobia (fear of flying). His fears, however, are not consistent. An example is in Water Sports where he is not that, if at all afraid of water. In season 4, Oggy becomes a more outside and playful cat, as he is seen outside of his house in his yard for most season 4 episodes.Oggy usually wins in many number sports except in The Bathtub Race. He won in Formula 1, Run, Olivia, Run!, To Serve and Protect, Shift that Chariot Oggy!, Mister Cat, From Mumbai with Love, and many more except in The Bathtub Race as Dee Dee won in that. In Winner Takes All and its remaster, Oggy claims that he won Jack in the chess match after Joey stole the pawn and disturbed their sleep. However after a fight between the brothers, Oggy concluded that he didn't win after he saw the cockroaches with the pawn.Oggy is a light blue cat with overweight body and red jellybean-like nose which can be removed. He also has a pink tongue, a grey tummy with squiggly belly-button, whiskers on four yellow circles and black pointy ears. This is paired with white gloves and white feet which has resembled to be shape of a teddy bear.He also has an oblong-shaped tail and whenever his gloves are removed, his hands are barely blue. In Little Tom Oggy, he can use his nose as a flashlight in dark places. In Jealousy, Fame & Glory, Showtime! and Olivia, he can't feel anything when surprised. Oggy always wields a red flyswatter, but in some episodes, it, yellow or green.";
